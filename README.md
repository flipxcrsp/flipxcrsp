# 👋 Hello there, I'm Phil (flipxcrsp)

This space is where I keep track of the things I’m learning and experimenting with.  
I like diving into labs, modules, and tools.

Troubleshooting systems, exploring security workflows, or just tinkering with different platforms.  

It’s less about polished projects and more about documenting the process and what I pick up along the way.
